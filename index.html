	<h2 id="Facts">- Facts about me -</h2>
	<p id="age">I am 18 years old, I was born on April the 16th in 2001.
		I live near Paris, in Colombes, with my parents and one of my two brothers. I actually study in a Business School, called EMLV. It is located in La Defense. I decided to study business because I love talking with people, meeting new persons : I love human contact. I also love economics and marketing courses, and english a lot.

	<h2 id="travels">- My travels -</h2>
	<ul>
		<li class="travels">I went to Spain, in April 2019. I was with my hole family : my parents, my two brothers, my aunts and uncles, and my cousins.</li>
		<li class="travels">I also went to the United States last Christmas. We went with my family to Boston and in the Vermont.</li>
		<li class="travels">Moreover, I went to Amsterdam 5 years ago, to visit the city, and it was a beautiful landscape, with the river. </li>

	<h2 id="experiences">- My experiences -</h2>
	</ul>I went to Cardiff 3 years ago, for a linguistic stay. It was an experience really rewarding, because I had the possibility to talk with my host family, and people in the street. I also worked at the Castle of Versailles, for my internship in middle school, and it was fantastic because I discovered, first of all, the Castle, and also many professions that were very interesting.
